## My process
I began by ostructuring my project layout with semantic tags. Once I had each element in the order I wanted it to appear I then went in with css and styled each element in a manner to best match the design files.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I am currenlty in the process of learning javascript and react and wanted to take a break to work on basics and practice trying to code naturally. 
I was surprised with how quickly I was able to get this set up and overall learned that I know more than I give myself credit for :)


### Continued development

I look forward to expanding on the basics and the possiblities of adding additonal functionality and styling to future projects.
